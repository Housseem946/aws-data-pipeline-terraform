# Serverless Data Pipeline on AWS with Terraform

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **fully serverless data pipeline** using **AWS services** and **Terraform**. It is designed for learning, portfolio-building, or as a production-ready starting point for simple ETL tasks.

The pipeline is triggered when a CSV file is uploaded to **Amazon S3**, processes the file using an **AWS Lambda function written in Python**, and inserts the transformed data into a **PostgreSQL RDS** database.

All infrastructure is provisioned via **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using **Terraform** and is fully compatible with the **AWS Free Tier**.

    A[CSV File Uploaded to S3] --> B[AWS Lambda Triggered]
    B --> C[ETL in Python]
    C --> D[Write to RDS PostgreSQL]
```
##  Features

-  Automated ingestion of `.csv` files from S3
-  Python Lambda for file parsing and transformation
-  Data loaded into Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
-  Fine-grained IAM permissions for each component
-  Fully reproducible with Terraform

 ## How to Deploy

 1. Configure AWS CLI (once)
```
aws configure
```
2. Initialize and apply Terraform
```
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform apply
```
3. Upload a CSV file to S3

Place a file (.csv) into the newly created S3 bucket (youâ€™ll see the name in Terraform output):

```
aws s3 cp ../data/sample.csv s3://<the bucket name>/
```
4. Lambda will be triggered automatically

Check the logs in CloudWatch to debug or monitor the execution.
